# GIS5572 Repository

This repository is for GIS 5572 Spatial Data Science course. It contains code and files used when doing coursework and submitting of final project items.

## Files

This repository is set up with a folder for each lab or project. Within each folder will be a readme with an in depth description. Currently, we have these folders:

* Lab 1 -- Creating data pipeline from ArcGIS primitives to cloud services.

## Running the code

A majority of the runnable code is written in Python files (.py) and Python Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb). The Jupyter notebooks typically run in ArcGIS Pro, so they require arcpy installation. Within each lab folder is a readme with a greater description of how to run the files.
